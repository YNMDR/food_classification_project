# food_classification_project

<h2>Goal:</h2><p>The goal of this project is to classify ten kinds of food images into their classes. I used deep learning concepts to create a model that can classify the images</p>

<p>The system is implemented using tensorflow, relying on Google Colabs for prototyping purposes and hardware requirements.</p>



<h2>Demo:</h2>

I experimented on three models:
<li>
  <ul>Baseline model --> accuracy:- 20.68%</ul>
  <ul>Used efficientnet v2 model without data augumentation --> accuracy:- 91.96%</ul>
  <ul>Used efficientnet v2 model with data augumentation --> accuracy:- 92%</ul>
</li>


<h2>Confusion matrices of three models:</h2>
